# Lily's Mods
this is my big modpack that introduces some new mechanics that have been suggested in the Baba Is You discord before!

to install: extract the "Scripts" and "Sprites" folders into the world you wish to use the mod with - **make sure you have my modloader installed! (in [#assets-are-share](https://discordapp.com/channels/556333985882439680/560913551586492475/570613317782208513) pins on the [Baba Is You discord](https://discord.gg/GGbUUse))**
